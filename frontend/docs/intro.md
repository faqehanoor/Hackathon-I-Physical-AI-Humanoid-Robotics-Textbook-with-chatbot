# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI combines **machine intelligence** with **real-world physical systems**, such as robots, drones, and humanoids.

##  What is Physical AI?

Physical AI =  
**AI Brain + Physical Body + Real-World Interaction**

Modern robots use:
- Sensors (LiDAR, Cameras, IMU)
- Control Systems (ROS 2)
- Simulation (Gazebo, Isaac Sim)
- AI Models (VLA, LLMs)

##  Why Humanoid Robots?

Humanoids match human environments:

- Can walk stairs  
- Use human tools  
- Fit in human spaces

# Examples of Physical AI Systems

### 1. **Humanoid Assistants**
- Lifting objects  
- Understanding commands  

### 2. **Industrial Robots**
- Manufacturing  
- Assembly  

### 3. **Autonomous Mobile Robots**
- Navigation  
- Mapping  
- Obstacle avoidance
